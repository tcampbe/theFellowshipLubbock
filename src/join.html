        How to Join
      </h2>

      <p>
        We welcome your petition for membership at The Fellowship. 
        There are several ports of entry into our fellowship, 
        and we will work diligently to accommodate you and your needs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Anyone may join regardless of background, race, or social status, 
        by professing faith in Jesus Christ as the only begotten 
        Son of God. This profession will be followed by baptism 
        by immersion in compliance with the Holy Scriptures. 
        You then to attend a one-hour long orientation session which 
        helps you understand what programs we offer. 
        This orientation explains our church structure, programs, 
        and expectations. You receive helpful materials and have 
        a chance to ask questions about any concerns you may have. 
        Upon completion, and mutual agreement, you have the option 
        to join The Fellowship.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you belong to a Southern Baptist Church previously, 
        then all that is needed, is the information about your 
        former church. Our office will take care of the rest.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you're coming from a sister church of another denomination, 
        the orientation class will help us decide what steps we 
        need to take to move you over into our congregation. 
        This is necessary to ensure your happiness and 
        fruitfulness as you attend here at The Fellowship.
